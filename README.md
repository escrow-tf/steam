# Steam

## ⚠️🚧🚧 so very under construction 🚧🚧⚠️

This library is very work-in-progress, and only implements features that we need. If you need more features, check out [go-steam](https://github.com/Philipp15b/go-steam) or [SteamKit](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit).

This library implements:

- [x] Authenticating with Steam (Steam Guard only)
- [x] Retrieving Econ Inventories
- [x] Retrieving TF2 Player Inventories
- [x] Trade Offer Operations (GetOffer, GetOffers, Create, Accept, Decline, Cancel)
- [ ] Mobile Confirmations
